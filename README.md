Flippy Flappy is a broswer based version of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, but with an added twist!  Built using HTML5 Canvas, Flippy Flappy not only allows the user to score points by negotiating the bird through pipe sets, but also awards points for every backflip achieved!

A live version of the game can be found here: http://bpcoxjr.github.io/flappy-bird-main/site/.
